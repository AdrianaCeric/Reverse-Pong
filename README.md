# Reverse-Pong üèì
Project for Hack The North 2020++! Pong with a twist.

## Inspiration
We wanted to have fun at this hackathon and create a reverse version of the classic Pong game. For some of us, it was our first time making a game, so it was a great learning experiance! :+1:

## What We Used
- This project was made using the [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) programming language
- We Used [Happy Coding Documentation](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/collision-detection#edge-collision-detection) to learn about collision detection!
- Figma for design conceptualization
